## PROJECT TOPIC: E Commerce  Sales Analysis in Nigeria  

### Project overview
This project aims to analyze e-commerce sales data within Nigeria to uncover key trends, customer behaviors, and business opportunities in the rapidly growing Nigerian digital market. As e-commerce continues to expand across the country, understanding sales patterns, regional preferences, popular product categories, and seasonal fluctuations can provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers.

The project involves collecting and analyzing sales data from Nigerian e-commerce platforms, either through publicly available datasets, web scraping, or API integrations. It will focus on identifying the most profitable product segments, customer demographics, peak shopping periods, and regional differences.

By leveraging data analysis techniques such as descriptive statistics, visualization, and predictive modeling, this project aims to support strategic decision-making for Nigerian e-commerce businesses. Ultimately, the goal is to foster sustainable growth in the Nigerian online retail sector through actionable insights derived from real-world sales data.

## Data Sources for the Project


1. Public Datasets

  * Kaggle: Often hosts datasets related to e-commerce sales globally, including Nigeria-specific data.

  * UCI Machine Learning Repository: May have relevant datasets for retail or sales analysis.
  * Data.gov.ng: Nigeria’s open government data portal that may include economic or retail data relevant to your analysis
2. Web Scraping

  * Scrape sales data from popular Nigerian e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Konga, or PayPorte, respecting their terms of service.
  * Extract product prices, sales counts, reviews, and regional data to build a dataset.
3. APIs

  * Use APIs from Nigerian e-commerce platforms (if available) to access sales data.
  * Google Trends API: Analyze search interest for popular products across Nigeria.
  * Social media APIs to gauge customer sentiment and product popularity.
    
4. Third-party Market Research Reports

  * Reports from organizations like Statista or McKinsey may have relevant aggregated data or insights on Nigeria’s e-commerce 
    market.

  These diverse sources have helped me build a comprehensive understanding and effectively analyze the required information.

## Tools used:

1. SQL/Database Management [Download here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms)
 * MySQL or PostgreSQL (for storing data)
2. Data Visualization
 * Tableau, Power BI (interactive dashboards)   
 * Matplotlib, Seaborn (Python visualization libraries)
3. Web Scraping & API Access

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

1. Handle Missing Data & Remove Duplicates

 * Identify and fill or remove missing values; eliminate duplicate records for accuracy.
   
2. Convert & Standardize Data

 * Format data types (dates, numbers) properly; normalize text (lowercase) and handle inconsistent units.
   
 3. Create Features & Filter Outliers

 * Generate relevant features (e.g., date parts, categories), and detect/remove outliers for reliable analysis.

   ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Tasks

1. Summary Statistics

 * Use describe() to get insights into sales amount, prices, and quantities (mean, median, min, max).
 * Check data distribution for numerical variables.
   
2. Data Visualization

 * Histograms for sales volume, prices, and customer orders.
 * Bar charts for top product categories, regions, or customer segments.
 * Time series plots to analyze sales trends over time (daily, monthly, quarterly).
 * Pie charts for market share by product or region.

3. Correlation Analysis

 * Compute correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables (e.g., price vs. sales).
 * Use heatmaps for visual representation.
   
4. Customer Insights

 * Analyze purchase frequency per customer.
 * Trend analysis based on demographics or location.
5. Regional & Product Trend Analysis

 * Identify top-performing regions and product categories.
 * Seasonal patterns and sales fluctuations across different periods.
   
6. Outlier Detection
 * Detect and visualize outliers in sales or prices to ensure data quality.
